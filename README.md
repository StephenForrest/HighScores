HighScores
==========

A simple python class to manage high scores

Just import or copy the 2 classes in the highscores.py file to your program
Class breakdown:

Score - This is much like a record class, or a named tuple. Basically it is a simple object that contains a name
and a score associated with that name, you call this class for each new record

ScoreTable - This class is to be called once per highscore table, and add to it the score class using the AddScore
method.
